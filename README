A notifier for WeeChat which interfaces with Snarl's network notification system.

For options take a look at /help snarl.

Very useful across networks when combined with SSH port forwarding. On the system
running Snarl, SSH to the system running WeeChat, forwarding remote port 9887 to
local port 9887. Then set snarl-net-notify to send messages to localhost:9887.
Messages will be forwarded back to the local machine, and should pop up in Snarl.

If you recieve errors claiming that Snarl isn't accepting network connections,
make sure Snarl is configured to list for incoming Growl and Snarl notifications.

Tested with WeeChat 0.3.0 and Snarl 2.21.
